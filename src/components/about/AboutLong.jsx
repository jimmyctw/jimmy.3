            <p>Hi! I am Jimmy!<br/><br/>
                I was born and raised in Taipei, Taiwan. I studied in Taipei, Heidelberg and Kyoto. <br/>
                I was studying German Language and Culture at Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City. <br/><br/>
                After completing my bachelorâ€™s degree, I continued my study in Germany and pursued my master degree in Transcultural Studies with focus on Japan at Heidelberg University.<br/><br/> 
                In the second year of my master, I did a one-year exchange promgram at #Kyoto University in Japan financed by JASSO's scholorship. On the second semester of my exchangeyear, I was invited by professor Ohnishi to participate a summer school held by Keio University. Due to my previous academic background and lived experiences, I can speak #Mandarin, #English, #German, #Japanese. <br/><br/>
                Currently I am improving my coding skills and wish myself to be a qualified frontend developer soon.<br/><br/>
